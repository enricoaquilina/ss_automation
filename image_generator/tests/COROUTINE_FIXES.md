# Coroutine Handling Fixes

This document explains the fixes implemented to resolve issues with coroutine handling in the Midjourney client integration.

## Issues Identified

1. **Improper Session Management**: Sessions were not always properly closed, leading to resource leaks and potential coroutine warnings.

2. **Unclosed Async Context Managers**: Some async context managers were not properly managed, causing "unclosed client session" warnings.

3. **Inadequate Error Handling**: Errors during cleanup weren't consistently caught, allowing exceptions to propagate and potentially break tests.

4. **Missing Task Cancellation**: Tasks weren't consistently cancelled during cleanup, leaving coroutines running.

5. **Improper Resource Cleanup**: The close methods didn't properly clean up all resources.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. In `test_slash_commands.py`:

- Simplified session management by ensuring consistent use of async context managers
- Removed redundant session creation and cleanup code
- Ensured clean error handling for network operations

```python
async def _get_recent_messages(self, limit=10):
    # Use bot token for retrieving messages
    headers = {...}
    url = f"https://discord.com/api/v10/channels/{self.channel_id}/messages?limit={limit}"
    
    # Proper async context manager pattern
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        try:
            async with session.get(url, headers=headers) as response:
                if response.status == 200:
                    result = await response.json()
                    return result
                # ...
        # ...
```

### 2. In `client.py` - DiscordGateway.close():

- Added proper task cancellation with checks for task state
- Added comprehensive error handling during cleanup
- Added session closure checks to prevent double-closure
- Added debugging output for better diagnostics

```python
async def close(self):
    """Close the connection and cleanup tasks"""
    self._closed = True
    
    # Cancel heartbeat task with proper error handling
    if self.heartbeat_task and not self.heartbeat_task.done():
        self.heartbeat_task.cancel()
        try:
            await self.heartbeat_task
        except asyncio.CancelledError:
            pass
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error cancelling heartbeat task: {e}")
        finally:
            self.heartbeat_task = None
    
    # Close WebSocket with error handling
    if self.websocket and not self.websocket.closed:
        try:
            await self.websocket.close()
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error closing websocket: {e}")
    
    # Clean up session with error handling
    # ...
```

### 3. In `client.py` - MidjourneyClient.close():

- Added cancellation of pending futures
- Added state reset and cleanup
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Added logging for cleanup operations

```python
async def close(self):
    """Close all connections"""
    try:
        # Close gateway connections
        await self.user_gateway.close()
        await self.bot_gateway.close()
        
        # Clear any pending futures
        if self.generation_future and not self.generation_future.done():
            self.generation_future.cancel()
        
        # Clear any upscale futures
        for variant, future in list(self.upscale_futures.items()):
            if not future.done():
                future.cancel()
        self.upscale_futures.clear()
        
        # Reset state
        # ...
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error closing client: {e}")
```

## Testing the Fixes

A new test script (`simple_coroutine_test.py`) was created to verify proper initialization and cleanup:

1. It tests the client initialization with session ID handling
2. It verifies proper resource cleanup on close
3. It can be run in both real and mocked modes

Run the test with:

```bash
./run_coroutine_test.sh
```

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Use Async Context Managers**: Always use async context managers (`async with`) for resources that need cleanup.

2. **Explicit Resource Management**: Be explicit about resource creation and cleanup.

3. **Consistent Error Handling**: Always catch and handle exceptions in cleanup code.

4. **Task Lifecycle Management**: Track and properly cancel any created tasks.

5. **State Reset**: Reset state variables during cleanup to prevent stale state.

These changes should resolve the coroutine handling issues while making the code more robust and maintainable.
