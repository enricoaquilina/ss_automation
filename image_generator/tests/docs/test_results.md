### Upscale Correlation Tests (May 13, 2025)

We implemented and tested fixes for the upscale correlation issue, ensuring that upscaled images properly match their parent grid images.

The following tests were performed:

1. **Unit tests for correlation mechanisms**:
   - ✅ Timestamp tracking (filtering out old upscales)
   - ✅ Grid message tracking (linking upscales to their parent grid)
   - ✅ Message ID tracking (preventing duplicate processing)
   - ✅ Content matching (matching prompts between grid and upscales)

2. **Integration tests**:
   - ✅ Complete correlation workflow test
   - ✅ Metadata correlation test

3. **End-to-end test**:
   - ✅ Mocked real test with the improved client

See [UPSCALE_CORRELATION_FIX.md](./UPSCALE_CORRELATION_FIX.md) for detailed information about the implemented changes.
