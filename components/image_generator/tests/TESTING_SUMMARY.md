# Midjourney Integration Testing Summary

## Current Status

All tests for the Midjourney integration are now passing reliably in both mock and live modes. The updated implementation properly uses Discord's Interactions API for sending slash commands following UseAPI.net documentation.

## Key Tests

1. **Token Validation** (`test_validate_token`): Verifies Discord credentials can authenticate.
2. **Slash Command Test** (`test_send_imagine_command`): Confirms proper API interaction for sending commands.
3. **Generation Tracking** (`test_generate_and_track`): Tests message flow monitoring for Midjourney generation.
4. **Full Workflow** (`test_complete_workflow`): End-to-end test of generation, upscaling, and storage.

## Major Improvements

### Hybrid Testing Approach

The test system now supports two modes:

- **Mock Mode**: For development and CI/CD without consuming Midjourney credits
- **Live Mode**: For real validation with actual Discord API and Midjourney service

### Upscale Correlation Fix

To address issues where upscaled images were sometimes incorrectly matched to the wrong prompt/grid image:

- **Timestamp Filtering**: Added timestamp-based filtering to prevent matching old upscales
- **Prompt Matching**: Implemented prompt text verification between grid images and upscales
- **Message ID Tracking**: Added tracking of processed message IDs to prevent duplicates
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Improved metadata storage with grid message references
- **Consolidated Test Suite**: Created comprehensive test suite in `test_upscale_correlation.py`

### API Reliability

- **Synchronous Requests**: Replaced problematic async context managers with synchronous requests for critical operations
- **Better Retry Logic**: Added improved retry mechanisms for Discord API calls
- **Error Handling**: More comprehensive error handling and logging

### Resource Management

- **Proper Cleanup**: Fixed session cleanup and resource management
- **Task Cancellation**: Added proper cancellation of background tasks
- **Context Management**: Improved usage of asynchronous context managers

### Documentation

- Added detailed testing documentation across several files:
  - `README.md`: General testing approach
  - `SLASH_COMMAND_TESTING.md`: Discord Interactions API testing
  - `COROUTINE_FIXES.md`: Fixes for asynchronous resource management
  - `README_TESTING_IMPROVEMENTS.md`: Overall improvements summary

## Running Tests

### Mock Mode (No API Calls, No Credits)

```bash
export FULLY_MOCKED=true
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_slash_commands.py -v
```

### Live Mode (Real API Calls, Consumes Credits)

```bash
export FULLY_MOCKED=false
export RUN_FULL_API_TEST=true
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_slash_commands.py -v
```

## Recommendations

1. Use mock mode for regular development and CI/CD.
2. Run live tests sparingly before major releases.
3. Keep Discord credentials secured and don't commit them to version control.
4. Remember that live tests consume Midjourney credits.
5. Consider rate limits when running multiple live tests in quick succession.
